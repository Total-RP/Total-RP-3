# Changelog for version 1.4

**This version requires Battle for Azeroth, patch 8.0.1.**

 ## Add-on communications improvement
 
 Total RP 3 implements the next version of the Mary Sue Protocol. This improved version bring the following improvements:
 - **Profiles are now logged on Blizzard's servers** when sent to other players. This is so Blizzard can see what's the actual content of people's RP profiles in case of reported of abuses, like target harassment or doxxing. **This means that you should now treat what you put in your profile as if you were witting that content in /say** (_Goldshire_).
 - **Cross server and cross faction support with Battle.net friends:** the add-on can now use Battle.net to transfer data between two Battle.net friends, even if they are from a server that is not connected to yours or if they are from the opposite faction.
 - **Improved performances:** thanks to looser limitations and newer compression algorithms, all data transfers should be faster (sometimes up to 8 times faster for big Extended campaigns).
 
 **_It was not possible to make this newer protocol backward compatible with older versions (which will not work with patch 8.0 anyway) and cross add-on communications will only work between people using this newer version of the protocol._**

## New logos

Total RP 3 has a new original logo, to replace the modified game logo (which we obviously did not owned), that was commissioned to [EbonFeathers@Tumblr](https://ebonfeathers.tumblr.com/). Using the theme of classic D&D, this logo showcases that role-playing is all about picking the role _you_ want to play.


A new minimap icon also replaces the older one and showcases a classic D&D die.

## Added

- Added a new settings category called Advanced. Changing the settings on this page may break your experience of the add-on, so a warning message will be displayed to warn you when you modify something, and a reset button will allow you to reset all advanced settings to their default values.

## Modified

- You can no longer set your residence marker inside an instanced zone.
- Fixed several issues related to patch 8.0.1.

## Removed

- The map features have been temporarily disabled while we are still working on having them fixed for Battle for Azeroth. The entire world map UI has been completely re-implemented by Blizzard and it requires more or less a complete rewrite of how we handle map stuff.
- The system to upvote or downvote profiles have been removed. The system was confusing to new players and was incorrectly used by groups of people to downvote targeted people.
