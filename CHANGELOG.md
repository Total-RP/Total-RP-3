- Fixed an error when targeting battle pets that are participating in a pet battle ([ticket #96](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/96)).
- Fixed an issue where if you used a single space character for your class (like to indicate you have none) it would be considered as empty and your character's real class would be used instead ([ticket #103](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/103)).
- Fixed an issue where players with custom RP status from other add-ons sent via the Mary Sue Protocol would be shown as Out Of Character.

### Removed

### Fixed

- Improved the workaround for the text cursor misalignment issue brought by patch 7.3 in the EditBox. The text no longer go beyond the limits of the EditBox.

## [1.2.9.2] - 2017-09-14

### Fixed

- Implemented a temporary workaround for the issue introduced by patch 7.3 in the game's code that cause the misalignment of the text cursor in multi lines text fields. Note that this workaround is not perfect, and result in empty lines visible at the bottom of the text, but at least the cursor is actually on the right line. But Blizzard is aware of the issue and is working on fixing it properly on their end.

### Added

- Added Traditional Chinese and Korean localizations.

### Changed

- Renamed Chinese localization to Simplified Chinese.

### Removed
- Removed the option to change the detection pattern for NPC speeches, as it created many issues and there really wasn't a need for it.

### Fixed

- Fixed issues with patch 7.3.
