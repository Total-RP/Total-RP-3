# Version 1.3.0 ALPHA 2

This is the first alpha for version 1.3.0. This version will be packed with exciting new features!

# Fixes from alpha 1 to alpha 2

Fixed issue with the nameplates health bar where they would be hidden for enemies or for the self nameplate.

## New nameplate customizations

Total RP 3 will now customize the nameplates of friendly players by default! Here's what you get:

- The nameplates will now display the RP name of players instead of their character names
- The names are colored using the custom colors defined in the profile or the class color as a fallback.
- The health bars are removed from the nameplate so you only see names.
- You can enable the option to hide the names of players without an RP profile. You will only see the names of people with an RP profile, making it ridiculously easy to spot them in a crowd.
- All the customizations mentioned above are automatically disabled when you set your roleplay status to Out Of Character

All the points listed above have settings for you to toggle individual features on or off in the new Nameplates settings.

_Note: This is for the default nameplates only. It may work with other nameplates add-on, but it is not designed to. The [Total RP 3: KuiNameplates module](https://mods.curse.com/addons/wow/total-rp-3-kuinameplates-module) provides the same features specifically for the KuiNameplates add-on. Compatibility with more nameplates add-ons may come in the future._
