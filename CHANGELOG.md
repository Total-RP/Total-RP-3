# Changelog version 2.8.1

*Profile transfers will currently be much slower on Cataclysm Classic due to rate limit changes. We are looking into changes to alleviate this, but they will take time, please bear with us.*

## Fixed

- Fixed icons not showing in the tooltips on Classic.
- Fixed the "receiving profile" animated icon appearing as a green square on Classic.
- Fixed an issue when editing profiles with an invalid icon (for example, a Retail icon on Classic).
- Pasting a color code into the color picker field will now trim spaces that might have been copied with it to prevent issues.

# Changelog version 2.8.0

## Added

- Added a small indicator at the bottom of the tooltip while receiving updates to a profile.

## Changed

- Chat links will no longer display the added number at the end of the name when sent. (We've also learned that after 1 comes 2, not 12.)

## Fixed

- Fixed tooltip display issues when using non-English characters.
- Fixed error when displaying some NPC companion nameplates.
- Fixed errors when receiving profiles with a music theme not listed in the current addon version.
- Pets will no longer be asked to provide their profiles directly, as they can't reply.
- Fixed an issue where the addon would wait indefinitely for a profile if the transfer was interrupted, preventing from ever receiving that profile again until reload.

# Changelog version 2.7.2

## Added

- Added 4 musics and 8 images from patch 10.2.5.

## Changed

- Icons in the browser have been made bigger once again.
- The icon browser in the glance editor is no longer smaller than everywhere else.

# Changelog version 2.7.0

## Added

- Added 97 icons and 11 musics from patch 10.2.5.
- Added support for party/raid unit tokens in the "/trp3 open" command.

## Changed

- The icon browser has been further updated with a new look:
  - The list of icons shown is now bigger.
  - The currently selected icon is now highlighted and shows first in the list.
  - The search will now ignore punctuation in the icon name.
  - A text indicator will appear if a search hasn't returned any result.
- Additional Information preset fields can no longer be renamed to prevent confusion on the field to modify.
  - Preset fields which were renamed have been turned into custom fields and may need to be set again.
- Keybindings have been moved to a dedicated Total RP 3 category.

## Fixed

- Fixed own pet nameplate not customizing.
- Fixed an issue when trying to import a profile with an invalid music (when importing a Retail profile on Classic for instance).

# Changelog version 2.6.1

## Fixed

- Added profiles to the automation system to allow you to set different automation rules for different characters, especially useful for alternate forms, stance or specialization conditionals.
- Added a new "Launcher settings" category letting you control visibility of the minimap button and addon compartment entry, as well as modifying what actions are executed depending on how you click them (left/middle/right mouse button, with modifier key...).
- Added a guild members map scan.

## Changed

- Reworked the icon browser search to be asynchronous, in order to prevent issues related to the amount of icons in the game.
- Changed the nameplate visibility settings from checkboxes to dropdowns offering clearer control over which nameplates to display or hide.

## Fixed
