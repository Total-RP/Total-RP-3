--- Total RP 3
--- Localization system
---
--- This new system is based on a meta-table.
--- The goal here is to have IDE auto-completion by directly using the table and
--- accessing its indexes in the code, but actually having the meta table call
--- the localization functions on runtime to get the localized version of the text.

We found that you have manually inserted invalid codes inside your Total RP 3 profile.
This behavior is not supported at all and we strongly discourage anyone from doing it.
It can lead to instabilities and bugs inside the add-on, data corruption/loss of profiles and it also creates incompatibility issues with other add-ons (such as MRP).

## 1.2.11 - 2017-11-09

### Added

- Added support for the profile downloading indicator from and to the XRP add-on.

### Fixed

- Fixed an error when trying to whitelist a profile that has been flagged as containing mature content when the profile hasn't been entirely downloaded yet ([ticket #133](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/133)).
- Fixed an issue allowing the user to send empty NPC messages when using the Enter key ([ticket #124](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/124)).
- Fixed an error when targeting battle pets that are participating in a pet battle ([ticket #96](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/96)).
- Fixed an issue where if you used a single space character for your class (like to indicate you have none) it would be considered as empty and your character's real class would be used instead ([ticket #103](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/total-rp-3/issues/103)).
- Fixed an issue where players with custom RP status from other add-ons sent via the Mary Sue Protocol would be shown as Out Of Character.

### Removed

- Removed workaround for the text box issue introduced in patch 7.3 as this issue has been fixed in patch 7.3.2.

- Fixed an issue that could cause a larger than usual amount of Unknown profiles to be listed in the Directory.

### Removed

- Removed the downloading progression indicator in the tooltip for now as it was the cause of some of these issues. It will be brought back later with a better implementation.

--- @type fun(localeKey:string):string
---
---	# Total RP 3's New Localization System, TRP3_API.loc
---
---	## Description
---
---	We are using a meta table here to make it easier for us to access the locale content thanks to IDE code completion.
---	The IDE is reading the TRP3_API.loc field as a table and offer all the localization keys when typing TRP3_API.loc.
---
--- Yet, the metatable applied here (using an empty table) will instead use our TRP3_API.Locale.getText(localeKey) function
--- to fetch the localized version of the text.
---
--- For backward compatibility and convinience, the TRP3_API.loc meta table is also made callable.
--- This means we can get the localization by calling the table with a locale key string TRP3_API.loc("LOCALE_KEY").
--- The table call accepts more arguments. In that case, a string.format will be applied to the localized value,
--- so it become a quick shortcut to string.format(TRP3_API.loc.LOCALE_KEY, arg1, arg2, arg3)
---
--- ## Usage
---
---		local loc = TRP3_API.loc; -- local import for a shorter access
---
---		button:SetText(loc.LOCALE_KEY) 		-- Get the localized value for LOCALE_KEY
---		button:SetText(loc("LOCALE_KEY")) 	-- Backward compatible way to get the localized value for LOCALE_KEY (less efficient)
---		button:SetText(loc(loc.LOCALE_KEY)) -- This will work but is inneficient and should be avoided
---		button:SetText(loc(loc.LOCALE_KEY, arg1, arg2, arg3)) -- A string.format will be applied to the value of LOCALE_KEY using the given arguments
TRP3_API.loc = setmetatable({}, {

	-- When accessing a locale value via its key we call our locale function to get the localized text
	__index = function(_, localeKey)
		return TRP3_API.Locale.getText(localeKey);
	end,

	-- We can also "call" the table itself with either the key as a string (.ie TRP3_API.loc("GEN_VERSION")
	-- (this gives us backward compatibility with the previous system where we would call a function with keys as strings)
	-- Or using the direct value of the locale (.ie TRP3_API.loc(TRP3_API.loc.GEN_VERSION)
	-- (although this is less interesting)
	--
	-- We can even add more arguments to automatically apply a format (ie. TRP3_API.loc(TRP3_API.loc.GEN_VERSION, genVersion, genNumber))
	__call = function(table, localeKey, ...)
		local localeText;

		-- If a locale value for the key exists in our locale content we get its localized value
		if TRP3_API.Locale.keyExists(localeKey) then
			localeText = TRP3_API.Locale.getText(localeKey);

		else -- If it doesn't exist, we assume we want the actual text that was given as is
			localeText = localeKey;
		end

		-- If we were given more arguments, we want to format the value
		if #{...} > 0 then
			localeText = format(localeText, ...);
