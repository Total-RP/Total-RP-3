# Changelog version 1.6.0

## Personal notes

You can now write personal notes inside the addon !

These notes can either be written on your own profile (if you wish to take generic notes for your character), or on someone else's profile (the top field being tied to your current profile, the bottom field being common to all your profiles). These notes are obviously private, nobody else but you can see them.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-1.tga:480:480}

To access personal notes, simply click on the new Notes button on the target frame, or open a profile and click on the Notes tab.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-2.tga:240:120}

The register also received a checkbox to only display profiles on which you wrote notes.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-3.tga:480:120}

## Added

- Added HTML support for About templates 2 and 3. You can now use the full array of HTML tags while using those templates to format their fields, using the toolbar which is now visible for all templates.

{img:Interface\AddOns\totalRP3\resources\160-4.tga:480:480}

- Added compatibility with other RP addons for personality traits and HTML tags.

## Changed

- The "Report profile" buttons will now both link to the [support website's page on harassment via addons](https://battle.net/support/help/product/wow/197/1501/solution), as the in-game report feature previously added was an invalid method to report addon abuse. The popup will still show a timestamp for the profile's reception, which you can provide to Blizzard CS to help them track the offense.

## Fixed

- Fixed an error which could prevent the addon from loading.
- Fixed a compatibility issue for template 3 if the addon locale was not English.

## Removed

# Changelog version 1.6.1

## Music system rework

- Technical changes in patch 8.2 required us to change how music is handled by the addon. **This means the update is required for musics to work.** This change should be seamless and backwards compatible (music themes from profiles coming from outdated versions should still play fine).
- This allowed for the addition of musics previously unavailable (looking at you, void elf musics).
- The duration of all musics should now be visible in the music browser line tooltips.

## Changed

- Settings to increase color contrast in tooltips and chat have been consolidated in a single setting for both which can be found in the General settings. It also applies in more places, like the map scan tooltips.

## Fixed

- The anchor for the map scan button can now properly be set.
- Fixed a switch in Headers/Paragraph dropdown titles
- Fixed an error message that could be caused by other addons misusing official API functions.

# Changelog version 1.6.4

We are aware of a current issue on Retail causing **quest item usage from the objective tracker** to sometimes fail. While we do not have a fix for it just yet, **typing /reload after getting the error message** temporarily fixes the issue. Sorry for the inconvenience.

## WoW: Classic support

- Total RP 3: Classic is now available as a separate download on CurseForge and WoWInterface! Be sure to install it instead of the retail version of Total RP 3 if you plan on roleplaying in WoW: Classic.
- Important points to be aware of for the Classic version:
  - A few icons have been changed across the addon to replace missing icons in Classic.
  - Companion profiles have been disabled for mounts and non-combat pets, as Blizzard did not provide us with beta access. We will work on implementing them back as soon as possible.
  - Total RP 3: Extended will not be ported to Classic at launch. We will be evaluating if a Classic port makes sense for us to do at a later date.

## Changed

- When using the character map scan, characters with which you have set a relationship will now appear on top of the others.

- Added a setting to hide the map scan button if no scan is available.

  - If your addon language doesn't match a player's roleplaying language, you'll see a flag at the bottom of their tooltip indicating their roleplaying language.
  - This change is mainly aimed at Classic roleplayers, as only English RP realms were made.
- Added back buttons to toggle helmet and cloak display for Classic.
