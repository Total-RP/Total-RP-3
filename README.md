## Description 

**Total RP 3** aims to be the best way to **customize, describe and drive your role-play interactions**, by combining the powerful customization features from Total RP 2, new features requested by our users and a greatly improved user interface designed with usability in mind. With this add-on, you can fully customize all the information about your characters and companion (pets, battle pets, mounts), like the name, the description or even attach an image to represent them.

Our goal is to bring back the **simplicity** and **user-friendliness** of add-ons like MyRolePlay but **without sacrificing your freedom** when defining your roleplay characters and adding neat features that you'll never want to live without anymore.

Total RP 3 can understand and exchange data with roleplay addons like MyRolePlay and XRP, allowing you to consult profiles coming from these addons seamlessly.

Total RP 3 is also a **fully modular** add-on. You can choose exactly which features you want to use and won't be bothered by a complex user interface if you don't want to.

## Main features

- You can customize your characters and companions (battle pets, pets, and mounts) with a powerful **profile system** and quickly switch between profiles.
- Keep track of all characters and companions you met with **the directory**, a repository of profiles you have encountered.
- **Locate other Total RP 3 users on the world map** to see where people tend to gather. You can decide to appear on the map or not, or even appear only if you are in character.
- A customizable **target frame**, allowing you to easily access useful interactions for your roleplay target (see their profile, play their theme song).
- **Chat customizations** like OOC and emote chat coloring as well as full role-play names using custom colors in the chat. ([Details on Chat Formatting][chatf])
- **NPC speeches** to make an NPC say or do something during an event.
- Total RP 3 can communicate with **MyRolePlay**, **XRP** and other MSP add-ons so you can view other players information even if they are using another roleplaying add-on.
- A customizable **toolbar** with useful actions like switching from switching from one profile to another, switching from **IC to OOC**, from **AFK to DND**, **switching languages**, and more!
- **Import your existing profiles** from **Total RP 2**, **MyRolePlay** or **XRP**. ([Tutorial][import])
- **Mature profile filtering** to warn you before opening profiles that may contain mature content.
