## Description

**Total RP 3** aims to be the best way to **customize, describe and drive your role-play interactions** by combining powerful customization features with a clean and accessible user interface. With Total RP 3, you can fully customize all the characteristics of your characters and companions (pets, battle pets, mounts), like the name, the description or even attach an image to represent them.

Our goal is to bring the **simplicity** and **user-friendliness** of add-ons like MyRolePlay but **without sacrificing your freedom** when defining your roleplay characters, while still adding neat features that you'll never want to live without.

Total RP 3 can work alongside other roleplay addons like MyRolePlay and XRP, allowing for a truly seamless roleplaying experience regardless of which addon others may choose.

Total RP 3 is also a **fully modular** add-on. You choose exactly which features you want to use so you won't have to navigate through a complex user interface if you don't want to.

## Main features

- You can customize your characters and companions (battle pets, pets, and mounts) with a powerful **profile system** allowing you to quickly switch between your different profiles.
- Keep track of all the characters and companions you met with **the directory**, a repository of profiles you have encountered.
- **Find other Total RP 3 users on the world map** to see where people tend to gather. You can choose to hide yourself from the map, or to only show yourself while you're in-character.
- A customizable **target frame** containing useful interactions for your roleplay target, like opening their profile, playing their theme song, or altering your relationship with that character.
- **Chat customizations** like OOC and emote chat coloring as well as full role-play names using custom colors in the chat. ([Details on Chat Formatting][chatf])
- **NPC speech** to mimic NPC chat, whispers, yells and emotes.
- Total RP 3 can communicate with **MyRolePlay**, **XRP** and most other roleplaying add-ons so you can see and read through other players' profiles, even if they are using a different roleplaying add-on.
- A customizable **toolbar** with useful actions like switching from one profile to another, switching from **IC** to **OOC**, from AFK to DND, switching languages, and more!
- **Import your existing profiles** from **Total RP 2**, **MyRolePlay** or **XRP**. ([Tutorial][import])
- **Mature profile filtering** to warn you before opening profiles that may contain mature content.
