## Description 

Total RP 3 aims to be the best way to customize and describe your role-play interactions, by bringing together the powerful customization features from Total RP 2, new features asked by our users and a much better user interface, designed with usability in mind. With this add-on, you can fully customize all the information about your characters and companion (pets, battle pets, mounts), like the name, the description or even attach an image to represent them.

Our goal is to bring back the simplicity and user-friendliness of add-ons like FlagRSP and MyRoleplay but without sacrificing your freedom when defining your roleplay characters and adding neat features that you'll never want to live without anymore.

Total RP 3 implements the Mary Sue Protocol, which is also used by roleplay addons like MyRoleplay, XRP or even Total RP 2\. That means Total RP 3 can understand and exchange data with all these add-ons.

Also, Total RP 3 is a fully modular add-on. So even if it will greatly expand in the future, you can choose exactly which features you want to use and won't be bothered by a complex user interface if you don't want to. This is the main module which will be required to run any future expansion.

## Main features

- You can customize your characters and companions (battle pets, pets, and mounts) with a powerful **profile system** and quickly switch between profiles**.**
- Keep track of all characters and companions you met with **the directory**, a repository of profiles you have encountered.
- **Locate other Total RP 3 users on the world map** to see where people tend to gather. You can decide to appear on the map or not, or even appear only if you are in character.
- A customizable **target frame**, allowing you to easily reach useful actions about your roleplay target (see their profile, play their theme song).
- **Chat customizations** like OOC and emote detection and full role-play names using custom colors in the chat…
- **NPC speeches** to make an NPC say or do something during an event.
- Full Mary Sue Protocol implementation: Total RP 3 can communicate with MyRolePlay, XRP, Total RP 2 and other MSP add-ons so you can view other players information even if they are using another roleplaying add-on. ([Details on the MSP implementation][MSP])
- A customizable **toolbar** with useful actions like switching from switching from one profile to another, switching from **IC to OOC**, from **AFK to DND**, **switching languages**…
- **Import your existing profiles** from **Total RP 2**, **MyRolePlay**, **XRP**, flagRSP2 and flagRSP(MoP). ([Tutorial][import])
- **Mature profile filtering** to be warned before opening profiles that may contain mature content.
