> It is the `totalRP3.lua` file (not the .lua.bak files!) located in your `World of Warcraft/_retail_/WTF/Account/ACCOUNT_NAME/SavedVariables` folder (replace `ACCOUNT_NAME` with your actual account name, visible on the Battle.net launcher, usually WoW1 for accounts created after the introduction of Battle.net; replace `_retail_` with `_classic_` if you are using Total RP 3: Classic). You can just drag and drop it here, no need for a third party service.
