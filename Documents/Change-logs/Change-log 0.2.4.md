## New features / Improvements
* **New importation options**. You can now import profiles from MyRolePlay, XRP, flagRSP2 and flagRSP(MoP), in addition to Total RP 2 (and yes, even all of them, at the same time!).
*Notice : those add-ons have to be activated in order for Total RP 3 to get their information.*
* **You can now drag and drop "At first glance" slots to reorder them**.
* Added a lot of tutorials tooltips to several part of the add-on.
* Added new bindings options. You can now configure keystrokes to toggle the main frame and the toolbar.
* Added slash commands. Type /trp3 for more information.
* Enhanced loading sequence. Error during loading should be more understandable for better error reporting.
* Several minor improvements and stability enhancement.

## Bug fixes
* Fixed an issue when using Total RP 3 with a character for the first time when a profile for that character already exists (i.e. when importing previous profiles from Total RP 2).
* Fixed an issue with color tags in the character's tooltip.
* Fixed issues with some character realm name.
