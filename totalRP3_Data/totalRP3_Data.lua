-- This is a dummy addon in order to separate data from other players from the main saved variable.
-- We decided to do this due to the WoW bug happening when a save variable file is too large: can't be load and loss of all data.
-- By keeping the data external data aside from our own, we reduce de chances to lose our beautiful descriptions when the register is too large for example.
